    "\n",
    "This project draws inspiration from a specific aspect of a popular application called SplitWise. SplitWise basically helps people settle expenses among different people in a group in an efficient manner. It's easiest to understand with an example, so here's a minimal example (which we will actually get working later) : \n",
    "\n",
    "> * Bob pays \\$20 for gas, split between him and Alice. (Alice owes Bob \\$10)       \n",
    "> * Charles pays \\\\$20 for lunch, split between him and Bob. (Bob owes Charles \\$10)       \n",
    "\n",
    "How can they settle their debts? Of course, the simplest option is :\n",
    "\n",
    "> * Alice pays Bob the \\$10 she owes him    \n",
    "> * Bob pays Charles the \\$10 he owes him.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Alice, Bob and Charles are friends (we'll say they're in the same group from here on) then of course, it's easy for us to understand that intuitively, the most effective way to settle their debts would just be : \n",
    "\n",
    "> * Alice pays Charles the \\$10 that Bob owes him.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphically, we can represent this as follows : \n",
    "\n",
    "The utility of such an application is obvious. However, what's interesting is that this problem of finding the minimum number of transanctions that will lead to a group reaching a \"settled\" state, is actually **NP-Complete**. Also, it can actually be modelled in some interesting ways, including as an **integer programming problem**! \n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of this notebook, we will see one possible formulations of this problem, and also explore some extensions of the problem statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"problem_complexity\"></a>\n",
    "## 1.2 Problem Complexity ##\n",
    "\n",
    "This seemingly straightforward problem can actually be reduced to the well known **subset-sum** problem, which is NP-Complete. \n",
    "\n",
    "The subset-sum problem is defined as follows : \n",
    "\n",
    "> *Given a set of Integers $S$, determine the existence of a non-empty subset who's elements add up to a given integer $n$*\n",
    "\n",
    "One possible transformation of our problem into the subset-sum problem is as follows : \n",
    "\n",
    "> Initialize the subset $S$ with all amounts of money owed     \n",
    "Set each integer $n$ to the amount of money owed to each individual    \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that finding an optimal solution to this problem for large sets of transanctions is computationally intractable, and interestingly enough, [according to the founder of the actual SplitWise app](https://www.quora.com/What-algorithm-or-solution-do-the-people-at-Splitwise-use-for-its-debt-simplification-feature) they use a greedy solution (which, as greedy algorithms often go, isn't always optimal but run in reasonable time).\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"data\"></a>\n",
    "## 1.3 Data ##\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this notebook is synthetically generated by a Python script that writes to a CSV file. The CSV file is in the format : \n",
    "\n",
    "> (owed by), (owed to), (amount owed)\n",
    "\n",
    "This format was chosen because even though real transanctions most likely occur in the format : \n",
    "\n",
    "> (person who paid), (amount paid), (people splitting the expense)\n",
    "\n",
    "Transforming from that format to the one used by this notebook is simple, and therefore does not affect the modelling in any way. It would be simple to add some pre-processing to convert data between these two formats."

    "To understand the integer programming problem, let's go back to our minimal example and try and solve that. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can represent the transanctions in terms of a matrix $T$ such that :\n",
    "\n",
    "> each element $T_{ij}$ of the matrix is the amount of money (in dollars) **person $i$ owes person $j$.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a quick recap of the transanctions we had, simplified down : \n",
    "\n",
    "> Alice owes Bob \\$10    \n",
    "> Bob owes Charles \\$10\n",
    "\n",
    "So based on our above formulation of the $T$ matrix: \n",
    "\n",
    "> $T_{alice, bob} = 10$    \n",
    "> $T_{bob, charles} = 10$\n",
    "\n",
    "For convenience, let's assign integer indices to Alice, Bob and Charles as follows : \n",
    "\n",
    "> Alice = 1     \n",
    "Bob = 2     \n",
    "Charles = 3    \n",
    "\n",
    "We can now form our $T$ matrix : \n",
    "\n",
    "> $T = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 10 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 10 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note here that $T_{i,i}$ will always be zero (as you can't owe yourself any money).\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can construct a **settlement matrix $S$** which represents the optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define each element of $S$, **$S_{i,j}$ as they money that person $i$ needs to pay person $j$** in order for all debts to be settled. In our simple case, we can construct this trivially as : \n",
    "\n",
    "> $S = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 10 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "So our settlement matrix tells us that Alice must pay Charles \\$10, which is what we want. This is in some sense, our \"target\" matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intepreted in a different way, our $S$ matrix is also an alternate to our $T$ matrix, in the sense that it says \"Alice finally owes charles \\$10.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "The important thing to understand here, is that **we don't really care who pays who**, as long as everyone receives or pays what they're supposed to. We can express this as : \n",
    "\n",
    "> Net Amount for person $i$ = Amount owed to $i$ - Amount owed by $i$\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we represent that using the matrices we've constructed? \n",
    "\n",
    "> Net amount owed by $i$ = $\\sum_{j} T_{ij}$ _(sum along row $i$)_     \n",
    "> Net amount owed to $i$ = $\\sum_{j} T_{ji}$ _(sum along column $i$)_\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the net amount owed to or by each person must be the same in the the $S$ and $T$ matrices we arrive at this important **constraint** : \n",
    "\n",
    "> $\\sum_{j} T_{ji} - \\sum_{j} T_{ij} = \\sum_{j} S_{ji} - \\sum_{j} S_{ij}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, as long as this constraint holds, $S$ and $T$ are basically equivalent in the manner we require.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our task has now reduced to finding a sparisified version of $T$ that satisifies the above constraint!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we actually sparisfy $T$ though? \n",
    "\n",
    "One simple way of doing this is to express this as our objective:  \n",
    "\n",
    ">Minimize the number of elements of $S$ that are not 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "And to do this, we can turn to integer programming, by simply using a binary indicator variable to determine if an element of $S$ is zero or nonzero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, our final formulation is as follows : \n",
